We won't be using FUSE tomorrow.  You should pause that lab and do the reading below
or the wednesday lab is going to be rough:

  - [aeb's summary](https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/fs/fat/fat-1.html).
  - [data structure layout](http://www.c-jump.com/CIS24/Slides/FileSysDataStructs/FileSysDataStructs.html).
  -  [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_the_FAT_file_system).
     full description.  Perhaps more detail than you need, but useful
     for all the weird flags that can pop up.
  - [linux source](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/fs/fat/dir.c).
  - The file system implementation chapter from the "three easy pieces" book 
    (in the `docs/` directory).
  - Microsofts specification (in the `docs/` directory).
  - [forensic wiki](https://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/FAT) --- seems to be gone.

I'm going to redo some hints for FUSE after tomorrow.
